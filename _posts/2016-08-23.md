## 

Fewer and fewer workers in China since 2011 have put a damper on the nation's economic growth. Both annual gross domestic growth and the share of working population as a whole have been on the decline continuously for 4 years. 

The coeeficient of determination of this regression is 0.677, which indicates a decresing number of workers alone cannot explaine the whole story of China's sputtering economy. After three decades of breakneck growth, ecoomists say China is realizing convergence to developed nations. This means ginormous investment and strong human capital have enabled China to catch up with advanced countries. The pace of that advancement is slowing as China's human and investment capital bonuses are running out of steam.
