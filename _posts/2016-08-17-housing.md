Beijing and Shanghai dominate the market of luxurious housing in China, according to data compiled with the help of Import.io.

Six of the top ten most expensive villas listed on LuxuryEstate.com were from Shanghai. Another three locate in Beijing, and an unusual $151 million historical property with 32 bedrooms and bathrooms was from the picturesque city of Suzhou in Hangzhou province. 

Thirty years of breakneck economic growth have helped a small portion of the Chinese population gain ginormous wealth, boosting housing prices in first-tiers cities.
