## the yuan's devaluation  

China's yuan has depreciated about 10 percent to 6.688424 a dollar from its six-year high two years ago, after a surprise devalution last August and a stronger dollar following Great Britain's decision to exit the European Union.

The country's economic slowdown and weak global demand have put pressure on the yuan to make Chinese exports more attractive.

## Capital outflow

In the wake of a surprise devalution of the yuan, investors have been withdrawing money from China and looking elsewhere for higher valuation. 

A 27-month capital outflow streak from China slowed its pace to about $64 billion in the second quarter this year from a record $226 billion in the third quarter last year with a surprise yuan devaluation in August, according to the Institute of International Finance, a financial association tracking global investment flow.
